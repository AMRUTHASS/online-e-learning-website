    <h2><b>Question & Answers</b></h2>
        <!--for C-->
        <h3>C programming</h3> 
        <h4>1) What is C language?</h4>
           <p> C is a mid-level and procedural programming language. The Procedural programming language is also known as the structured programming language is a technique in which large programs are broken down into smaller modules, and each module uses structured code. This technique minimizes error and misinterpretation.</p>
        <h4>2) Why is C known as a mother language?</h4>
            <p>C is known as a mother language because most of the compilers and JVMs are written in C language. Most of the languages which are developed after C language has borrowed heavily from it like C++, Python, Rust, javascript, etc. It introduces new core concepts like arrays, functions, file handling which are used in these languages.</p>
        <h4>3) Why is C called a mid-level programming language?</h4>
        <p>C is called a mid-level programming language because it binds the low level and high -level programming language. We can use C language as a System programming to develop the operating system as well as an Application programming to generate menu driven customer driven billing system.</p>
        <h4>4) Who is the founder of C language?</h4>
        <p>Dennis Ritchie.</p>
        <h4>5) When was C language developed?</h4>
        <p>C language was developed in 1972 at bell laboratories of AT&T. </p>
        <h4>6) What are the features of the C language?</h4>
        <p>The main features of C language are given below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Simple:</b> C is a simple language because it follows the structured approach, i.e., a program is broken into parts</li><br>
            <li><b>Portable:</b> C is highly portable means that once the program is written can be run on any machine with little or no modifications.</li><br>
            <li><b>Mid Level:</b> C is a mid-level programming language as it combines the low- level language with the features of the high-level language.</li><br>
            <li><b>Structured:</b> C is a structured language as the C program is broken into parts.</li><br>
            <li><b>Fast Speed:</b> C language is very fast as it uses a powerful set of data types and operators.</li><br>
            <li><b>Memory Management:</b> C provides an inbuilt memory function that saves the memory and improves the efficiency of our program.</li><br>
            <li><b>Extensible:</b> C is an extensible language as it can adopt new features in the future.</li><br>
        </ul>    
        <h4>7) What is the use of printf() and scanf() functions?</h4>
        <p><b>printf()</b>: The printf() function is used to print the integer, character, float and string values on to the screen.

            Following are the format specifier:</p>
            <ul>
           <li> %d: It is a format specifier used to print an integer value.</li><br>
           <li>%s: It is a format specifier used to print a string.</li><br>
           <li>%c: It is a format specifier used to display a character value.</li><br>
           <li> %f: It is a format specifier used to display a floating point value.</li>
        </ul>
            <b>scanf()</b>: The scanf() function is used to take input from the user.
         <h4>8) What is the use of a static variable in C?</h4>
         <p>Following are the uses of a static variable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A variable which is declared as static is known as a static variable. The static variable retains its value between multiple function calls.</li><br>
            <li>Static variables are used because the scope of the static variable is available in the entire program. So, we can access a static variable anywhere in the program.</li><br>
            <li>The static variable is initially initialized to zero. If we update the value of a variable, then the updated value is assigned.</li><br>
            <li>The static variable is used as a common value which is shared by all the methods.</li><br>
            <li>The static variable is initialized only once in the memory heap to reduce the memory usage.</li><br>
        </ul>

                <h3>C++ programming</h3>
                <h4> What are classes and objects in C++?</h4>
                <p>A class is like a blueprint of an object. It is a user-defined data type with data members and member functions and is defined with the keyword class.</p>
                <h4>What are access modifiers?</h4>
                <p>You use access modifiers to define accessibility for the class members. It defines how to access the members of the class outside the class scope.
                    <br>
                    There are three types of access modifiers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Private</li>
                        <li>Public</li>
                        <li>Protected</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Difference between equal to (==) and assignment operator(=)?</h4>
                <p>The equal to operator == checks whether two values are equal or not. If equal, then it’s true; otherwise, it will return false.
                    <br>
                    The assignment operator = allots the value of the right-side expression to the left operand.</p>
                <h4>What are the four different data types in C++?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primitive/Basic: Char, int, short, float, double, long, bool, etc.</li><br>        
                    <li>Derived: Array, pointer, etc.</li>
                    <li>Enumeration: Enum</li>
                    <li>User-defined: Structure, class, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Java programming</h3>
                    <h4>1) What is JAVA?</h4>
                    <p>Java is a high-level programming language and is platform-independent.
                        <br>
                        Java is a collection of objects. It was developed by Sun Microsystems. There are a lot of applications, websites, and games that are developed using Java.</p>
                    <h4>2) What are the features of JAVA?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>OOP concepts</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Object-oriented</li>
                        <li>Inheritance</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism</li>
                        <li>Abstraction</li>
                    </ul>
                        <li><b>Platform independent</b>: A single program works on different platforms without any modification.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>High Performance:</b> JIT (Just In Time compiler) enables high performance in Java. JIT converts the bytecode into machine language and then JVM starts the execution.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Multi-threaded:</b> A flow of execution is known as a Thread. JVM creates a thread which is called the main thread. The user can create multiple threads by extending the thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.</li>
                </ul>
                    <h4>3) How does Java enable high performance?</h4>
                    <p>Java uses Just In Time compiler to enable high performance. It is used to convert the instructions into bytecodes.</p>
                    <h4>4) Name the Java IDE’s?</h4>
                    <p>Eclipse and NetBeans are the IDE’s of JAVA.</p>
