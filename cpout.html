                <li>	
                    <iostream> - This file defines the cin, cout, cerr and clog objects, which correspond to the standard input stream, the standard output stream, the un-buffered standard error stream and the buffered standard error stream, respectively.</li>
                        <li>	
                            <iomanip> - This file declares services useful for performing formatted I/O with so-called parameterized stream manipulators, such as setw and setprecision.</li>

                                    <fstream> - This file declares services for user-controlled file processing. We will discuss about it in detail in File and Stream related chapter.</li>
